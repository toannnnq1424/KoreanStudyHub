 * Bean-Validation point of view — leaving every field blank means
 * "OAuth login is disabled". The controller performs an additional
 * cross-field check (when {@code googleClientId} is non-blank the matching
 * {@code googleClientSecret} must also be present).
 *
 * <p>The {@code googleClientSecret} field is loaded and rendered in plain
 * form so admins can review what is currently stored. On save, a blank
 * value means "keep the existing secret unchanged".
