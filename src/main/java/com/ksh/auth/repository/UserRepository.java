/**

 * every default query (including derived queries and JPQL projections) silently
 * excludes soft-deleted records. Methods that NEED to see soft-deleted rows
 * (admin Restore, admin DELETED-filter list) are declared with explicit native
 * SQL to bypass the annotation.
 *
 * <p>Email lookups are case-insensitive across the application; the database
 * column uses {@code utf8mb4_unicode_ci} collation and the
 * {@code findByEmailIgnoreCase} derived query compiles to a
 * {@code LOWER(email) = LOWER(?)} comparison, so mixed-case input from any
