/**
 * Raised when an AI chat call cannot be completed.
 *
 * <p>Three distinct situations produce this exception, all deliberately funnelled into
 * one type so callers only need a single catch block:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>no provider is configured, or every configured provider is disabled;</li>
 *   <li>a provider rejected the request permanently (HTTP 400/401/403) — the chain
 *       stops immediately because retrying a different provider cannot fix a malformed
 *       request or a bad credential, and would only burn quota;</li>
 *   <li>every enabled provider was tried and each failed transiently — the message then
 *       lists one {@code "<name>: <reason>"} line per provider so an admin can see which
 *       endpoint broke and why.</li>
 * </ul>
