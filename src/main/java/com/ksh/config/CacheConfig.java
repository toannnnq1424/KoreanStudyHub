/**
 * Application-wide Spring Cache configuration backed by Caffeine.
 *
 * <p>Defines a single {@link CacheManager} bean used by {@code @Cacheable}
 * and {@code @CacheEvict} annotations across the codebase. The cache is
 * intentionally bounded and short-lived so it can never grow without
 * limit and so admin-driven changes propagate quickly even if a write-through
 * eviction path is ever missed.
 *
 * <p>Registered caches:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code settingsGroup} — caches the result of
 *       {@link com.ksh.features.admin.settings.service.SystemSettingsService#loadGroupAsMap(String)}
 *       keyed by setting group name (e.g. {@code SMTP}, {@code OAUTH}).
 *       Write-through invalidation is performed by
 *       {@link com.ksh.features.admin.settings.service.EmailSettingsService#save} and
 *       {@link com.ksh.features.admin.settings.service.OauthSettingsService#save}.</li>
 *   <li>{@code userPermissions} — caches the resolved effective permission set of a
 *       single user, keyed by user id. Write-through invalidation is performed by
 *       {@code PermissionResolver}'s eviction methods whenever a role permission or a
 *       user override changes.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Tuning rationale:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code expireAfterWrite = 5 minutes} — safety net for entries that
 *       might otherwise leak if an eviction path is forgotten. Five minutes
 *       is well inside acceptable propagation latency for admin-edited values.</li>
 *   <li>{@code maximumSize = 50} — covers the four known setting groups
 *       ({@code GENERAL}, {@code SMTP}, {@code OAUTH}, {@code AI}) with
 *       comfortable headroom for future additions, while keeping the cache
 *       footprint tiny.</li>
 *   <li>{@code userPermissions} needs its own, much larger bound: it holds one entry
 *       per signed-in user, so the 50-entry settings cap would thrash and send every
 *       request back to the recursive permission view. It is therefore registered
 *       against a separate Caffeine spec rather than the shared one.</li>
 * </ul>
