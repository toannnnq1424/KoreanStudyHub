/**
 * Shared class-access policy for student-facing lesson surfaces (lessons list,
 * lesson detail, comments). Centralizes the "who may view/moderate a class's
 * lesson thread" rule so callers no longer repeat it inline.
 *
 * <p>The rule: ADMIN/HEAD bypass enrollment (they moderate any class), the
 * owning lecturer passes, and otherwise an ACTIVE enrollment is required. Any
 * other caller collapses to a single {@link EntityNotFoundException} with the
 * canonical message so class existence is never leaked.
 *
 * <p>This is intentionally separate from {@link LessonAccessResolver}, which
 * owns only lesson resolution + the PUBLISHED gate; access policy stays here so
 * each caller can order the two gates as its no-leak contract requires.
