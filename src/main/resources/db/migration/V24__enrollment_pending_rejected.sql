-- join-class-approval — expand enrollments.status with PENDING and REJECTED.
--
-- Invite CODE/LINK self-join now creates PENDING rows that require the class
-- owner to approve (→ ACTIVE) or reject (→ REJECTED). Import/manual paths stay
-- ACTIVE. MySQL names anonymous CHECKs as <table>_chk_<n>; look up the status
-- constraint by clause text so this migration stays robust across environments.
