 * Maps section/lesson activity type constants to their Vietnamese display

 * carry different type vocabularies — sections do RENAMED, lessons do UPDATED
 * plus PUBLISHED/UNPUBLISHED — and a forced union would either lose context
 * (a single "modify" label) or invent a label-per-entity-pair lookup that
 * doesn't simplify anything. Unknown types pass through as their raw key so
 * future activity types render until labelled.
