/**
 * Outcome of a confirmed import.
 *
 * <p>Counts are mutually exclusive — every input row appears in exactly one of
 * {@code imported}, {@code reactivated}, {@code skippedDuplicate} (silent skip
 * for already-active members), {@code skippedError} (rows blocked by hard
 * errors), or {@code failed} (rows that errored at persist time).
 *
 * @param totalProcessed   total number of rows considered during this confirm
 * @param imported         newly inserted enrollments
 * @param reactivated      previously REMOVED enrollments flipped back to ACTIVE
 * @param skippedDuplicate rows skipped because the student was already ACTIVE
 * @param skippedError     rows blocked by validation errors (when skip-errors is on)
 * @param failed           rows that errored at persist time (DB constraint, etc.)
 * @param rows             full per-row report — caller may surface this in the UI
