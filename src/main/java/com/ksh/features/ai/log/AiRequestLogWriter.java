/**
 * Commits a single {@code ai_request_logs} row in its own short transaction.
 *
 * <p>Split out of {@link AiRequestLogger} on purpose. The swallow-the-failure
 * try/catch has to sit <i>outside</i> the transaction boundary: catching a
 * persistence exception inside a {@code REQUIRES_NEW} method still leaves that
 * transaction marked rollback-only, and the commit at method exit then throws
 * {@code UnexpectedRollbackException} straight into the AI call site — the very
 * failure the catch was meant to prevent. Separating the two means Spring's proxy
 * really does wrap only the insert, and the caller can catch whatever escapes.
 *
 * <p>{@link Propagation#REQUIRES_NEW} rather than the default: the AI call sites are
 * intentionally non-transactional, and a caller that later rolls back must not erase
 * the record of the attempt that caused it.
 *
 * <p>The insert takes no lock on {@code ai_providers}: {@code provider_id} deliberately
 * carries no foreign key (see {@code V51__admin_ai_request_logs.sql}), so there is no parent
 * row to wait on and no lock-wait timeout to bound here.
