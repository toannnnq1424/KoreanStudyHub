/**
 * Refuses matrix changes that would lock every administrator out of the system.
 *
 * <p>The role x permission matrix is editable, which means an admin could in principle
 * detach the very permissions that guard user management and the permission screens
 * themselves. Doing so is unrecoverable through the UI: with {@code system.permissions}
 * gone from ADMIN, nobody can reach the screen that would put it back, and with the
 * USER_MANAGE group gone, nobody can promote another account either. This guard makes
 * that state unreachable by rejecting the detach before it is applied.
 *
 * <p>Only the ADMIN role is protected. Detaching the same permissions from STUDENT,
 * LECTURER or LEADER is legitimate — those roles are not the recovery path.
 *
 * <p>Pure component: it inspects its arguments and either returns or throws. It mutates
 * no state, opens no transaction, and touches no repository, so it is safe to call from
 * inside a caller's transaction before any write happens.
